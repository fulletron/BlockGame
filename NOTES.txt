*Create a "PaneAsset" base class -- OPTIONAL
*Implement the pulsing announcement class
*Send messages from the brain to the announcement panel. Announcement queue?
*Get a pane to draw on a pane.
*Decide how to handle drawing in different resolutions ( currently things scale, which may end up being what i want )
*Make CMAKE know how to traverse the filepath itself
*Alter text to not change pixel resolution upon loading
*Make CMAKE copy internal files to the correct directory when building the project

A background picture now draws. not a very good one, but that doesn't matter at this point (art related).
Also, text now is LOADED based on screen res... maybe this is wrong? (probably wrong).

===================== 9/10/2015 ============================
CMake now properly sorts files into a folder hierarchy in visual studio (matching that of the source code
folder structure). I can probably mimic the macro I made and create a deepdiving way to find/add all the
src .h and .cpp files as well. I also created the bkgpicpasset, but it isn't functional yet.

Added the TO DO list on the top here


=============== 9/4/2015 ===============
I'm using a singleton as of right now for the game "brain" (all logic, non graphical elements). The reason is to 
easily access brain members (read-only) from the panel side to access member variables of varying data 
types. This causes a lot of old code to break (panel assets don't exist anymore, but will in a new incarnation
if this method is followed).

Ideally I wouldn't use a singleton, and instead, I would add a:
_UNION8 getPresentationElement8(int)
_UNION16 getPresentationElement16(int)
to IPresentable. This would allow me to get copies (COPY) of the pertinent data without having to have a 
Class * defined for every IPresentable object I was using (instead I could use the IPresentable/IPanelAsset list 
exclusively, making a lot of stuff less directly connected (I could get away from the singleton/top down)

This doesn't solve having to probe the brain for the IPresentable to add it to the list- essentially, I'd have to 
have a fairly encompassing brain function that accepted some kind of key and deep dived (top down) to find
the specific IPresentable. It would only happen once though. And it still is probably cleaner than having
a singleton, but I can change that later- that is backend stuff that doesn't result in seeable changes, and
I'm in need of some instant gratification.
