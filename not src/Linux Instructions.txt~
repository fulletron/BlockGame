1) sudo apt-get install git

2) Create a Repo directory (in this example, named Repo)

3) Clone the repo into the directory. 
	(from within the repo directory)
	git clone https://github.com/fulletron/BlockGame.git

4) Get all of the prereqs, which include:
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake freeglut3-dev mesa-utils libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libxxf86vm-dev

5) Build boost within the boost directory located at
BlockGame/src/External/boost_1_55_0
	5a) make sure that ./bootstrap.sh is executable
	5b) make sure that ./tools/build/v2/engine/build.sh is executable
	(COMMAND LINE COMMANDS)
	5c) bash ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=thread,timer,filesystem,chrono,atomic,date_time,regex,system
	5d) ./b2

6) Create another directory outside of the repo ( in this example, it will be called BlockProj )
	preferably, create the BlockProj folder beside the Repo folder	

7) Within the BlockProj folder, use cmake to generate the projects makefiles
	CMD LINE
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../Repo/BlockGame/src/

8) Make the resulting makefile, which is in the same dir as the previous function call
	make -f Makefile

9)
