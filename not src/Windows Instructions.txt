1) Get the latest version of Git
	http://git-scm.com/

2) Create a Repo Directory (for example, ./Desktop/Repo)

3) Clone the repo. ( from ./Repo )
	git clone https://github.com/fulletron/BlockGame.git

4) Get the latest cmake
	http://cmake.org

5) Create a folder to hold the project ( for example, ./Desktop/Proj )

6) Create the project using cmake
This can be achieved using command line, or the cmake gui
	Using Command Line, from ./Proj, call 
		FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2010
		cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ../Repo/BlockGame/src
		FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2012
		cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" ../Repo/BlockGame/src
		FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2013
		cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ../Repo/BlockGame/src

7) ./Proj should now contain the VS Project.
	The main project exe is the Game project.
	There are at least 2 tests- they are in the Test directory, 
	and have the suffix "Tester"
	IE- UtilitiesTester Project.

NOTE:: I tried this on a new windows surface 4 i3 and it worked.


OLD INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOOST BASED:

1) Get the latest version of Git
	http://git-scm.com/

2) Create a Repo Directory (for example, ./Desktop/Repo)

3) Clone the repo. ( from ./Repo )
	git clone https://github.com/fulletron/BlockGame.git

4) Build Boost by running ALL_BOOST_SETUP.bat in
	./Repo/BlockGame/src/External/boost_1_55_0/

5) Get the latest cmake
	http://cmake.org

6) Create a folder to hold the project ( for example, ./Desktop/Proj )

7) Create the project using cmake
This can be achieved using command line, or the cmake gui
	Using Command Line, from ./Proj, call 
		FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2010
		cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ../Repo/BlockGame/src
		FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2012
		cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" ../Repo/BlockGame/src
		FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2013
		cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ../Repo/BlockGame/src

8) ./Proj should now contain the VS Project.
	The main project exe is the Game project.
	There are at least 2 tests- they are in the Test directory, 
	and have the suffix "Tester"
	IE- UtilitiesTester Project.

NOTE:: If these instructions fail, it is quite possibly due to the computer 
missing opengl necessities (the biggest red flag being CMake reporting "OpenGL NOT FOUND")
I haven't came across that yet, but it is a possibility- I'll try on a clean
windows image soon!
